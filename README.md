# Shakespeare

In this project we will be looking at a Shakespeare dataset that contains all the lines spoken from shakespeare's works, the play it was spoken in, the Act Scene and Line number, the Player Line number, and the Player who spoke the line. We explore ways to make this dataset more valuable with some feature engineering. We then make a classifier that predicts the "Player" based on our dataset. Finally we explore how much value the features we made actually added to the dataset.
